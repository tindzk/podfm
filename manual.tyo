.chapter[Introduction] {
	.p {
		podfm is an extensible podcatcher for the console. It
		provides the possibility to write provider-specific plugins.
		This is especially useful when providers offer additional
		content such as transcriptions which general-purpose
		podcatchers usually ignore.
	}

	.p {
		Currently the only supported provider is
		.url[http://www.rfi.fr/]{RFI}. An Atom/RSS plugin is
		planned to support a wider range of providers.
	}
}

.chapter[Installation] {
	First make sure that the aforementioned requirements are met.
	Then checkout and compile the code using:

	.command {
		git clone git://github.com/tindzk/podfm.git
		cd podfm; ./build.sh
	}
}

.chapter[Getting Started] {
	.p {
		podfm can download files locally to disk or to an external
		device like a media player. Therefore, podfm maintains a cache
		file keeping track of already downloaded podcasts.
	}

	.p {
		By default, the configuration path points to the current
		directory. However, this can be configured in
		.path{config.h}. But you can also pass a different path via
		parameter.
	}

	.p {
		The configuration path must contain a file called
		.path{subscriptions.yml} with the following layout:
	}

	.code {
		providerId1:
			first subscription
			second subscription

		providerId2:
			...
	}

	As for RFI, the file may look like:

	.code {
		rfi:
			Podcast_DANSE
			Podcast_SAV
			Podcast_VEN
			journalFrancaisFacile
			rss_apprendre_francais
	}

	To synchronize, just run:

	.command {
		./podfm.bin /mnt/ipod
	}

	Consequently, the cache file as well as the podcasts will be
	stored in the given path.
